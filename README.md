# Bitbucket Cloud Plugin

Jenkins plugin for managing Bitbucket Cloud workspace credentials and testing read-only access.

## Configure

Open **Manage Jenkins → System → Bitbucket Cloud** and add one connection for each workspace:

1. Enter the Bitbucket Cloud workspace slug.
2. Select a credential from the Jenkins Credentials store.
3. Use **Test connection** to verify that the credential can read the workspace.

Supported credential type:

- **Bitbucket Authentication** — Bitbucket username and API token/app password.

Credentials are selected from Jenkins system/global credentials. Grant each credential sufficient Bitbucket Cloud
permissions to read its workspace. The connection test sends a read-only request to the fixed Bitbucket Cloud API
endpoint and requires Jenkins administrator permission. It does not modify workspace data.

## Build

    mvn verify
